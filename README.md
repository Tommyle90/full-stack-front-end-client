## Objective

* Create a full-stack application to keep track of all the meals a user has eaten

* [Front-end repo](https://github.com/Tommyle90/full-stack-front-end-client)
* [Back-end repo](https://github.com/Tommyle90/full-stack-back-end-client)
* [Meal Tracker Application](https://tommyle90.github.io/full-stack-front-end-client/)

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* SASS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Handlebars
* AJAX
* Bootstrap

## Thought Process & Steps

* Setup proper repos using templates and deploy both front-end(GitHub) and back-end(Heroku).
* Built and test user authentication on the back-end
* Built a table of Meals with columns of mealtype, date, and description
* Made validations so that only the current user can see their information.
* Test out all the CRUD actions
* Made it so that the user can only input certain criteria in the mealtype form
* Work on CSS HTML and Javascript on front-end to see how it looks
* Deploy

## User Stories & Wireframe

* User signs up
* User selects the date they want to input data in
* User inputs the type of meal (ie: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
* User gets the date when they submit a meal type
* User inputs the meal description ie 'I ate eggs and toast'
* User can sign out

## Future Implementations

Down the line I would have a Food table that connects to the meal
Food that has these columns
* calories
* fats
* carbs
* proteins
* meal_id
